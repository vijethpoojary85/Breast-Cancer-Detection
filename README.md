# Breast-Cancer-Detection

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and survival rates.
My project's goal is to use Deep Learning to provide a more precise method of diagnosing breast cancer. In order to detect breast cancer, our approach uses Deep Learning techniques like convolutional neural networks. The outcome demonstrates that this methodology is far more effective than others, with accuracy levels  92%. Moreover, a web app is also deployed for user-friendly, in order to detect any subsequent sample patient image for predicting benign or malignant.
The project aims to assess whether a breast lump could be malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using digitized histopathology images of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy  Dataset .
